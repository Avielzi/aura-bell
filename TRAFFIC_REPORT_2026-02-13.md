## Insights  
- Peak traffic times occur between 7 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM.  
- Areas with the highest delay are primarily located near downtown intersections.  

## Recommendations  
- Implement smart signal control systems to manage peak traffic hours effectively.  
- Increase public transport availability during peak hours to reduce vehicle count.  
- Conduct further studies on routes with high delays to evaluate the need for alternative routing options.

## Conclusion  
The introduction of smart traffic management systems and adjustments to public transport can significantly improve traffic flow and reduce delays throughout the city. This report serves as a foundation for future studies in urban traffic management.
